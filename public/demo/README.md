# Demo videos

Add pool footage here for testing:

- `pool-demo.mp4` - Used as default demo video in Live Feeds
- `alert.mp3` - Optional alert sound when distress is detected (any short sound file)

You can use any short pool/swimming video for testing. For best results with AI analysis, use footage that shows people in water (normal swimming or simulated distress drills).
